### Syncing Data for Maxthon 5 Users

For users upgrading from Maxthon 5, your data will be automatically synchronized when you log in to the new version of Maxthon for the first time. Please note:

- Bookmarks, Maxnote, Password, and Quick Access will automatically import to your new Maxthon Browser. If you need to import browsing history or personal settings, you need to use the `Import local data and HTML file...` function, and select your Maxthon 5 logged account.
- Because Maxthon 5 and the new version of Maxthon store bookmark data in different folders, the data will be copied to the new Maxthon bookmark folder at the initial launch.
- To continue using Maxthon 5 data and syncing with Maxthon 5 client, please activate the **Maxthon Membership Service** and enable **Super Bookmark**. See [Super Bookmarks User Guide](supperfavor.md) for details.

### Automatic Data Import

Users upgrading from Maxthon 5 will have their bookmarks, passwords, Maxnote, and other data automatically imported, even if not logged in. If you face any problems with automatic data import, you can still import manually.

- Due to the upgrade in technology, plugin data from Maxthon 5 cannot be synchronized to the new version of Maxthon.

Should you need any assistance or encounter issues during the bookmark import process, please contact support at [help@maxthon.com](mailto:help@maxthon.com).
