### Download Failure or Interruption üö®
**Question**: What should I do if there is an error or interruption during video download?

**Answer**: If there is a network interruption during the download, it may result in only the first half of the video being downloaded.

The video format for downloads is currently webm, compatible with all major browsers. If you need to convert it to another format, you can use conversion software or websites.
