## Changes about Classic features

The traditional Maxthon functions have been retained in Maxthon 6. Compared with Maxthon 5, Maxthon 6 has made adjustments:

#### Resource sniffer

**Use Resource Sniffer to collect media files from any webpage**
In the early versions of Maxthon 6, the resource sniffer is turned off by default. It has changed in the latest ones. If your resource sniffer has been turned off and you need to use it, you can turn it back on by clicking the puzzle piece icon on the top right and open the add-on manager by clicking the cog icon at the bottom of the pop window.
On any pages that you need to start your resource sniffer, you may type the shortcut keys you set, and refresh the webpage. You can reset the resource sniff shortcut keys in the add-ons manager > shortcuts.
There is a guide below, you can make your changes by following the steps.

#### Sidebar offline

To keep a simpler design, the sidebar has been taken off in Maxthon 6, and Maxnote is still retained. Your favorite websites' bookmarks are moved to an independent bookmark page (mx://bookmarks/) and showed on the bookmark bar on top of the browse window. Maxthon notes (mx://note/) can still be accessed from the main menu button. The RSS subscription function in the sidebar before is not available for now, you can install an extension instead.
For more information about the functions of Maxthon notes, please go to [**Maxnote**](08-mxnote)

#### Passkeeper

The function of the passkeeper (mx://password/) is the same as Maxthon 5, but the general identity information function in Maxthon 6 is temporarily unavailable. However, your data in Maxthon 5 is not lost. You can still log in to **UU.Me** [https://www.uu.me/](https://www.uu.me/) to view online.
For more information, please go to [**Passkeeper**](10-passwords)

#### UUmail

UUmail no longer provides a quick entry in Maxthon 6, but it's fully functional in [**UU.Me**](https://www.uu.me/). You can add [uu.me](https://www.uu.me/) to your bookmarks and continue to use the UUmail.
