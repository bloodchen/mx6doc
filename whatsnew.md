![themes](images/themes.gif "= 85%, 85%")

Inherited from Maxthon 5, the new Maxthon provides various UI customization options (mx://settings/appearance). We provide three classic themes, and more themes are available in [**Maxthon add-on center**](https://webstore.maxthon.cn/). You can also apply skins in the chrome extension center.

## Changes about Classic features

The traditional Maxthon functions have been retained in the new Maxthon. Maxthon has made adjustments:

#### Resource sniffer

**Use Resource Sniffer to collect media files from any webpage**
The resource sniffer is turned off by default.  If your resource sniffer has been turned off and you need to use it, you can turn it back on by clicking the Main menu icon on the top right and open the feature manager, enable the resouce sniffer in the pop out window.


#### Passkeeper

The function of the passkeeper (mx://password/) is the same as Maxthon 5, but the general identity information function in the new Maxthon is temporarily unavailable. However, your data in Maxthon 5 is not lost. You can still log in to **UU.Me** [https://www.uu.me/](https://www.uu.me/) to view online.
For more information, please go to [**Passkeeper**](10-passwords)

#### UUmail

UUmail no longer provides a quick entry in Maxthon, but it's fully functional in [**UU.Me**](https://www.uu.me/). You can add [uu.me](https://www.uu.me/) to your bookmarks and continue to use the UUmail.
