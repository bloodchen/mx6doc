### The icon can't be found on the desktop after clicking the Add button

Some users did not find the shortcut icon on the home screen after clicking "Add" of the certain function, because the system turned off the "add to home screen" function in the Maxthon browser. Please go to the system settings and turn on the "create desktop shortcut" switch for the Maxthon browser. After turning the switch on, please return to the Maxthon browser and click "Add" again.
